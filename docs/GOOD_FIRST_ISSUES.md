# Good first issues

Pick an **open labeled issue**, comment that you are taking it, then open a PR
that references the number (`Closes #N`). This page is an index. The GitHub
issue is the source of truth.

**Open good first issues:**
https://github.com/HelloblueAI/bleujs-reasoning-lab/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22

Ask questions on the issue if you are stuck. Run `pnpm run check` before you
open a PR. You do not need API keys or Cloudflare access for the benchmark and
docs tasks.

## How to claim

1. Comment on the issue (`I'll take this`) so two people do not start the same
   task.
2. Fork and branch from `main` (`feat/…`, `fix/…`, or `docs/…`).
3. Keep the change to that issue only.
4. Fill in the pull request template and mention the issue number.

If nobody has replied after a few days, you can still open the PR — just say so
in the description.
