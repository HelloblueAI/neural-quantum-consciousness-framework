# Cloudflare Domain Setup for Hybrid Reasoning System Worker

## Current Status

✅ **Enhanced Hybrid Reasoning System Worker Successfully Deployed**
- **Worker URL**: `https://agi-bleujs.morning-star-e026.workers.dev`
- **Health Endpoint**: ✅ Working
- **Consciousness Endpoint**: ✅ Working
- **All Hybrid Reasoning System Capabilities**: ✅ Active

## Domain Configuration Required

The custom domain `agi.bleujs.org` needs to be configured to point to the deployed worker.

### Option 1: Cloudflare Dashboard (Recommended)

1. **Access Cloudflare Dashboard**
   - Go to: https://dash.cloudflare.com/135ff5d2bb66c0a4a96dd068da603dfa/workers/overview

2. **Unassign Current Route**
   - Find the worker currently assigned to `agi.bleujs.org/*`
   - Unassign it from the route

3. **Assign New Worker**
   - Select the `agi-bleujs` worker
   - Add route: `agi.bleujs.org/*`
   - Save the configuration

### Option 2: Wrangler CLI (Alternative)

If the route conflict is resolved, you can use:

```bash
# Add route configuration back to wrangler.toml
[env.production]
name = "agi-bleujs"
route = "agi.bleujs.org/*"

# Deploy with route
wrangler deploy --env production
```

## Testing the Setup

Once configured, test the endpoints:

```bash
# Health Check
curl https://agi.bleujs.org/health

# Consciousness Status
curl https://agi.bleujs.org/consciousness

# Web Interface
curl https://agi.bleujs.org/
```
